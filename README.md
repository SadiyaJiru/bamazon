# Bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront application that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock 
from the store's inventory. Uses MySQL and Inquirer npm packages for data input and storage.


**Future Enhancement**
App will track product sales across store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing 
departments in the store.
